# Stanford-AIMI-Summer-Internship-Code
This repository contains the code that I used to develop machine learning models (convolutional neural networks) for analyzing the medical chest X-Rays. 
The models also predict the type of medical device present in the image and gives an estimate of the device's coordinates using a bounding box.
In addition, I analyzed the results of the models using statistical methods and created graphs to compare the accuracies for each type of medical device.
